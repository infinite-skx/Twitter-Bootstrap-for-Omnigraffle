TWITTER BOOTSTRAP FOR OMNIGRAFFLE
========================================

**Note:** These tools were created for Omnigraffle 6 and 7. While they will likely work with Omnigraffle 7, they haven't been tested in that version of the app.

This is a set of Omnigraffle stencils, colors, and templates that mirror [Twitter Bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) as closely as possible. 

INSTALLATION
------------

Install as few or as many items as you need. 

* *Stencils/Twitter-Bootstrap.gstencil*
  * Stencils grouped by type, along with one all-encompassing stencil.
* *Templates/Twitter-Bootstrap.gtemplate* and *Templates/Twitter-Bootstrap-classic.gtemplate*
  * Starter template with grid system and guides.
  * The first one uses guides  most faithful to Bootstrap, even though they are often placed at decimal points.
  * The *-classic* version is retained from the previous release. It's less faithful to the current grid system, but more usable for people who rely on Omnigraffle's pixel grid.
* *Colors/Twitter-Bootstrap.clr*
  * Swatches for your color picker.

### Install the stencils and templates (OmniGraffle 6 and Omnigraffle 7)

* Double-click the stencil or template to open it in OmniGraffle
* Click the **Move** button to install it locally

### Install the stencils and template (OmniGraffle 5)

* Drag or copy the stencil file to `~/Library/Application Support/The Omni Group/OmniGraffle/Stencils`
* Drag or copy the template file to `~/Library/Application Support/The Omni Group/OmniGraffle/Templates`

(If you have an older version of OmniGraffle these folders may be in `~/Library/Application Support/OmniGraffle/`)

### Install the color swatches

* Drag or copy the colors file to `~/Library/Colors`

**Note:** Recent versions of OSX hide the user's Library folder by default. You can access it in Finder by holding down **Option** while opening the **Go** menu then clicking on **Library**.
